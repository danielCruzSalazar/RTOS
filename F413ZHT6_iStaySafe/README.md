## Description

<p align=justify> iStaySafe is a system that seeks to generate awareness about health and the excessive consumption of alcoholic substances in people of all ages. It is common to go out to parties on weekends and consume some type of alcoholic beverage. So the iStaySafe allows us to have a more exact control over our vital signs and if it is a good time to stop drinking. In the same way, it seeks to have a total monitoring in terms of heart rate and blood oxygenation, trying to prevent any accident at any time of the day. All this through the connection of the STM32F4ZHT6 card and various sensors that will communicate with a web server, obtaining data and averages.</p>
